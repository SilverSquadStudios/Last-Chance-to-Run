# Summary of the game
This is the main repository to store all the data belonging to the game last chance to run. Members: Zaid, Pradeep, Tomas, David. The initial game was created for the SkilsUSA Illinois competition and since then we have decided to work on it more and make it into a full fledged game that would be on the iOS App store and the Google play store.
